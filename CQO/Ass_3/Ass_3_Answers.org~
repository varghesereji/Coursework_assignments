* Problem 1

A beam with a photon flux of 1000 photons s^{-1} is incident on a detector with a quantum efficiency of 20%. If the time interval of the counter is set to 10s, calculate the average and standard deviation of the photocount number for the followin g scenarios:
- (a) :: the light has Poissonian statistics;
- (b) :: the light has super-Poissonian statistics with \Delta n=2\times \Delta n_{Poisson} ;
- (c) :: the light is in a photon number state.

** Answer
\phi = 1000/s, \eta=20%, t=10s

- (a) :: $\bar{n} = \frac{L \phi}{c}$

  But, $L=ct \Rightarrow \bar{n} = t \phi$

  Then, $\bar{n} = 10000$.$

  $\Delta n = \sqrt{n} = 100$

  The photocount number is given by, $$(\Delta N)^2 = \eta^2(\Delta n)^2 + \eta(1-\eta) \bar{n}$$

  $\Rightarrow$, $$\Delta N = 44.721$$.

  $$\bar{N} = \eta \bar{n} = 2000$$


- (b) :: Given $\Delta n = 2\times \Delta n_{Poisson}$.
  i.e., $\Delta n = 89.442$

  
  
  We know that, for super poissonian statistics,

  $$(\Delta n)^2 = \bar{n} + \bar{n}^2$$.

  $\Rightarrow$

  $$ \bar{n} + \bar{n}^2 = 4 \bar{n}_{Poiss}^2 = 8000$$

By solving this,

$$\bar{n} =88.944$$


$$\Delta N = 18.28, \bar{N} = 17.79$$

- (c) :: In phton number state, $\Delta n=0$. That means, there is no variation from mean value. Then, $\bar{n} = 10000$

$\Rightarrow$
$$\bar{N} = 2000, \Delta N = 40$$

* Problem 2
Calculate the values of g^{(2)}(0) for a monochromatic light wave with a square wave intensity modulation of \pm 20%.

** Answer

$$g^(2)(0) = \frac{<I(t)^2>}{<I(t)>^2}$$

Since the intensity modulation is A=0.2, let us write, $$I(t) = I_0(1+0.2\Theta(T/2))$$

$\Theta$ is a square pulse.
$$<I(t)>^2 = I_0^2$$

$$<I(t)^2> = \frac{I_0^2}{T} \int_0^{T} (1+0.2\Theta(T/2)) ^2$$

Then,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
g^{(2)}(0) & = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T dt (1+0.2\Theta(T/2))^2 \\
 & = \frac{1}{T} \left[\int_0^Tdt+0.4\int_0^{T/2}dt+0.04\int_0^{T/2}dt\right] \\
& = 1+0.2+0.02\\
& = 1.22
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


Then, $$g^(2)(0) = 1.22$$


* Problem 3
The 632.8 nm line of a neon discharge lamp is Doppler-broadened with a linewidth of 1.5GHz. Sketch the second-order correlation function g^{(2)}(\tau) for \tau in range 0-1 ns.

** Answer
The coherence time is given by the formula

$$\tau_c = \frac{\lambda^2}{c\delta \lambda}$$

Given, $\Delta \nu = 1.5GHz$.

And, $d\lambda = \frac{c}{\lambda^2} d\nu \Rightarrow \tau_c = \frac{1}{d\nu}$

$\therefore$

$$\tau_c = 6.67e-10s = .667 ns$$

From Mark Fox,

$$g^{(2)}(\tau) = 1+\exp\left[-\pi\left(\frac{\tau}{\tau_c}\right)^2\right]$$

* Problem 4
For the coherent states |\alpha> with \alpha=5, calculate
- (a) :: the mean photon number;
- (b) :: the standard deviation in the photon number;
- (c) :: the quantum uncertinity in the optical phase.

** Answer
- (a) :: $\alpha = 5$. Then, $\bar{n} = |\alpha|^2 = 25$

- (b) :: $\Delta n = |\alpha| = 5$

- (c) :: $\Delta \phi = \frac{\text{uncertinity diameter}}{\alpha} = \frac{1/2}{5} = \frac{1}{10}$
* Problem 5
A ruby laser operating at 693 nm emits pulses of energy 1mJ. Calculate the quantum uncertinity in the phase of the laser light.

* Problem 6
For the coherent state |\alpha> with \alpha=|\alpha|e^{i\phi}, show that $<\alpha|\hat{X}_1|\alpha>=|\alpha|\cos\phi$ and $<\alpha|\hat{X}_2|\alpha>=|\alpha|\sin\phi$. Show further that $\Delta X_1 = \Delta X_2 = \frac{1}{2}$.

* Problem 7
Prove that for two coherent states |\alpha> and |\beta>,
$$|<\alpha|\beta>|^2=\exp(-|\alpha-\beta|^2)$$
