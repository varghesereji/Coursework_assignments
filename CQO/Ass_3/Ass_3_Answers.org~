* Problem 1

A beam with a photon flux of 1000 photons s^{-1} is incident on a detector with a quantum efficiencyj of 20%. If the time interval of the counter is set to 10s, calculate the average and standard deviation of the photocount number for the followin g scenarios:
- (a) :: the light has Poissonian statistics;
- (b) :: the light has super-Poissonian statistics with \Delta n=2\times \Delta n_{Poisson} ;
- (c) :: the light is in a photon number state.

* Problem 2
Calculate the values of g^{(2)}(0) for a monochromatic light wave with a square wave intensity modulation of \pm 20%.

* Problem 3
The 632.8 nm line of a neon discharge lamp is Doppler-broadened with a linewidth of 1.5GHz. Sketch the second-order correlation function g^{(2)}(\tau) for \tau in range 0-1 ns.

* Problem 4
For the coherent states |\alpha> with \alpha=5, calculate
- (a) :: the mean photon number;
- (b) :: the standard deviation in the photon number;
- (c) :: the quantum uncertinity in the optical phase.

* Problem 5
A ruby laser operating at 693 nm emits pulses of energy 1mJ. Calculate the quantum uncertinity in the phase of the laser light.

* Problem 6
For the coherent state |\alpha> with \alpha=|\alpha|e^{i\phi}, show that $<\alpha|\hat{X}_1|\alpha>=|\alpha|\cos\phi$ and $<\alpha|\hat{X}_2|\alpha>=|\alpha|\sin\phi$. Show further that $\Delta X_1 = \Delta X_2 = \frac{1}{2}$.

* Problem 7
Prove that for two coherent states |\alpha> and |\beta>,
$$|<\alpha|\beta>|^2=\exp(-|\alpha-\beta|^2)$$
