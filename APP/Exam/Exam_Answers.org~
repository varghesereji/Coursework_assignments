* Question 2
** (a)
The signal from KM3NeT is collected from Photo Multiplier Tubes. Mainly it uses two parameters: time3 and charge. The amplitude of hitting is measured in the unit photon-electrons or p.e., and it should exceed an initial threshold level. In KM3NeT, the hit threshold is set as 0.3 p.e.

  - Levels :: There are two levels mainly for the data acquisition. First one is L0 or level 0. This is referred to the basic signal. Majority of L0 will be single p.e. and they are mainly coming from the deep sea optical background. L0 rate depend on the properties of PMT, and the optical properties of the location where the detector is placed. The PMT quantum efficiency is 30% for photons in the range $\lambda = 370-390 nm$, the maximum absorption length is 67.5m at $\lambda=440nm$. This is same for all sites. The data rate to store and the bandwidth of the communication line are defined by L0 rate. But this rate is too high to be used directly in the software triggers. So, we should define a high lebel hits with significantly lower rates. So, in KM3NeT, there is one more level. It is called level-1 (L1) hit, which is defined in a single multi-PMT DOM required at least two PMTs with L0 signals in a time interval of 10ns. T0 and T1 hits are based on a time correlation of L0 and L1 hits on the same storey. Here, T0 is defined as both L0 and L1 sigtnal on a single story within a time interval of 50ns and the T1 hits requires 2L1 hits. So, the data acquisition will happen based on L0, L1, T0, T1.

A physics event in the KM3NeT neutrino telescope is a collection of all hits in a predeﬁned time interval $t_{ev}$. The $t_{ev}$ time interval is centered on the ﬁrst triggered hit, and extended in both
directions by the time a muon needs to traverse the KM3NeT detector, about 10 ms. The minimal requirement for the reconstruction of a muon track with ﬁve parameters is at least ﬁve causally connected hits. To reduce the number of background hit combinations in the software ﬁlters, ANTARES is using only L1 hits in the trigger. For a large number n of background L1 hits the
number of all 5L1 combinations is close to n5, which makes the trigger search very time consuming. In our study we have considered trigger schemes based on L1, T0 and T1 hits.
For L0, the expected background rate is 4000Hz, 700Hz for L1, 30Hz for T0 and .005Hz for T1.[[cite:&2013]] 

** (b)
- (i) :: L1 hit is defined in a single multi-PMT DOM required at least two PMTs with L0 signals in a time interval of 10ns. So, if we change the distance, the event rate will change accordingly. It will be inversely proportional. Because, greater the distance between DOMs, the probablity to happen two L0 signal from two different PMT will decrease. Let us try to calculate this emperically.

  Assume that the particle come in all direction. After one PMT produced a signal, another PMT also should produce. Assume there is PMTs which are nearest neighbour to the PMT which first L0 happened. Assume $\theta$ is the angular diameter of the PMT setup. Better way is, if the particle which created L0 in first PMT, it will create L0 in another PMT in an angular range $\theta$. With this, the area of disk in this region is $\theta x$ where x is the distance from first PMT.
  Then the probability to happen second L0 is:
  $$P_{L0L1} \sim \frac{\theta x}{4\pi x^2} \sim \frac{1}{x} $$
  And the rate will be proportional to P_{L0L1}. So, an approximate plot is shown below.

  In the current situation, the rate is $5\times 10^{-2} Hz$ for the hit type T0. It will be varie from 0.5 to $15\times 10^{-2}$.

- (ii) :: In the current situation, L0 should happen in 10ns for L1. If we make it 20ns, the chance to happen L1 will be doubled. That also may reflect in the event rate. So, I think, the event rate will increase if we double the time window.
